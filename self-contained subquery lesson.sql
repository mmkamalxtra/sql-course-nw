Subqueries Lesson 1 - Self-Contained Subqueries

A self-contained subquery is independent of the outer query
It can be executed stand-alone.
It is executed once and the result is used by the outer query.  (As a result,it is generally more efficient than a correlated subquery

/*
This subquery returns a one column list to use in the WHERE <column> IN (...)
List every patient stay in any ward that has had at least one very expensive stay (a tariff over 9).
Notice that the result includes the cheaper stays in those wards too.

We could not get this result with a simple WHERE ps.Tariff > 9 on its own.

First run the subquery by itself to see the list of wards it returns.

Note: You can list the stays in all the other wards by using NOT IN
