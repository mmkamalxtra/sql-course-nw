Advanced: count the number of rows with a missing value for two columns in two steps.
(1) Create a calculated column: use CASE to return 1 or 0 for each row depending on whether both Colour and Style column values are NULL.
(2) Sum that column — the total is the count of rows with a missing value for both columns.

If we wanted to count rows where either Colour or Style is not NULL, how would we change teh statement?
